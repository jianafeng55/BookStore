# CS6400BookStore


## Instructions

- Make sure you have Apache in your computer and save all files in your Apache controllers(In my case it's /Library/Webserver/Documents/)
- I'll include the downloaded package of phpMyAdmin and have changed the parameters for you, put it in your Apache controllers and you can open it 
- If you have your own phpMyAdmin, please remember to change settings in "config.php" for database, just like the one I uploaded(config.inc.php)
- Open the phpMyAdmin in your computer (localhost/phpMyAdmin/). The username is root and the passward is QQqq199500
- Create a database in phpMyAdmin and name it "jianafeng"
- Import jianafeng.sql file included in the zip file 
- Open the website http://localhost/BookStore


## Data Preparation and Setup

- I have stored dataset in jianafeng.sql file, so operate just like the above Instructions. 
- My application will generate data when users sign up and enter their information and those information will be stored in the "users" TABLE in phpMyAdmin. 
And when users add books in their cart, this behavior will generate data and those data will be store in the "orders" TABLE in phpMyAdmin.
